1. INTRODUCTION
    Print a welcome message that introduces the program to the user.
    "Welcome to the safe file editor! This program allows you to edit files safely with backup."

2. DETERMINE OPERATION MODE
    If there is a command-line argument (filename):
        - Proceed to command-line mode.
    Else:
        - Proceed to interactive mode.

3. INTERACTIVE MODE (no command-line argument)
    a. Prompt the user: "What File Do You Wish to Edit?"
    b. Read the filename input from the user.
    c. Check if the file exists in the current directory:
        - If the file exists:
            i. Create a backup with ".bak" extension (overwrite if exists).
            ii. Log the backup operation with a timestamp in "backup_log.txt".
            iii. Open the file in a text editor (Notepad for MS-DOS, vi for Linux).
        - Else:
            i. Inform the user the file does not exist and exit.

4. COMMAND-LINE MODE (filename argument given)
    a. If more than one command-line argument is provided:
        - Print error: "Too many parameters entered."
        - Exit the program.
    b. If exactly one argument is provided:
        - Extract the filename from the command-line parameter.
        - Check if the file exists in the current directory:
            i. If the file exists:
                - Create a backup with ".bak" extension (overwrite if exists).
                - Log the backup operation with a timestamp in "backup_log.txt".
                - Open the file in a text editor (Notepad for MS-DOS, vi for Linux).
            ii. Else:
                - Inform the user the file does not exist and exit.

5. BACKUP AND LOGGING
    a. When a backup is created:
        - Copy the original file to a new file with a ".bak" extension.
        - Log the backup creation with timestamp in the log file.
        - Ensure the log file does not exceed 5 entries:
            - If the log file has more than 5 entries, delete the oldest entry.
        - Log format: "[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] Backup created: filename â†’ filename.bak"

6. LOG MANAGEMENT
    a. Open "backup_log.txt" for appending.
    b. Append a new entry with the timestamp and backup details.

7. FINALIZATION
    a. After completing the backup and file editing process, end the program.
    b. If the user successfully edits the file, print a confirmation message: "File edited successfully."
    c. If there are any errors or issues (e.g., file not found), print an error message: "Error: File not found."
